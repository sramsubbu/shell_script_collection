Scratchpad 
==========


This little script will create a new folder named 'scratch' in the current folder and spawn a new 
shell into that folder. When you exit the shell, the folder is deleted. 


## Installation 

Download the scratchpad file and copy it to one of the folder in your $PATH (or add the folder which has this script to $PATH). 
Alternatively you can run install on the script. 


## Usage 

``` sh
scratchpad [<folder_name>]
```


if no `folder_name` is given, then default to "scratch".
